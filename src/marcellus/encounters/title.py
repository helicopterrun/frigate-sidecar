"""Human titles for encounters ("who + route"). Pure: plain data in, a string
out -- no DB, no network, no config -- so the whole rule set is unit-testable
and the routes compute a title at read time (nothing is stored).

    Person and dog · Sidewalk → Front Garden → Front Door
    Amazon near Front Door
    Person · Gate Face camera
    Activity

**Who** is the encounter's recognised identities (names, then delivery
brands) followed by the subjects from its labels, in a fixed order -- people,
animals, vehicles, packages, then anything else (bins, doors) -- joined "A",
"A and B", "A, B and C". An identity only *replaces* the subject it names: a
personal name replaces "person"; a delivery brand replaces "person" and the
motor vehicles (Frigate hangs the brand sub-label on the van or its driver).
Every other subject stays, so "Chris" walking a dog reads "Chris and dog".

**Route** is the encounter's members in time order, each reduced to one place
(its first zone's display name, else the camera) with consecutive duplicates
collapsed. One place reads like a push title ("{Who} near {Zone}" /
"{Who} · {Camera} camera"); two to four are listed with arrows; more than four
keep the first two, an ellipsis and the last.
