"""Encounter notability: is this visit a passer-by ("background") or worth a
second look ("notable")?

Pure functions only -- no I/O, no DB, no clock reads. `store.recompute`
calls a *stamper* (see `stamper_for`) every time an encounter's members
change and writes the result into `encounters.tag/place/outcome/tag_reason`,
so the answer is fixed when the visit is recorded and a later settings change
never rewrites history. Nothing recomputes it at read time.

Rules, first match wins (docs/guide `encounters.md` has the user-facing
version):

1. two or more distinct cameras            -> notable, ``multi_camera``
2. reached a place other than the street   -> notable, ``left_public``
   (a member with no zones counts as its camera's place)
3. alert ladder says more than "log"       -> notable, ``alerted``
4. anyone/anything was recognised          -> notable, ``recognised``
5. an animal was seen (dog-walker aside)   -> notable, ``animal``
6. someone stayed in view `linger_s`      -> notable, ``lingered``
   (the longest single member, not the span)
7. it happened at night                    -> notable, ``night``
8. otherwise                               -> background, ``passer_by``
