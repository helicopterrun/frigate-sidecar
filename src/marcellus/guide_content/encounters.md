[Encounters](/encounters) groups Frigate review segments into the thing a
person would actually describe: "a raccoon worked its way from the alley to
the shed", "two people and a dog walked past the gate" -- one row instead of
three. It's an overlay: Frigate's `event` and `reviewsegment` tables stay the
source of truth and are only ever read.

Design spec: the repo's `docs/encounters.md`.

An **atom** is one Frigate review segment (one camera's already-bundled
concurrent objects). An **encounter** is an ordered chain of atoms across
cameras and time gaps. Every membership records why it joined ("shared zone
front_garden, 40s gap") and a confidence, so the detail page can explain
itself rather than just asserting a grouping.

Off by default (`enabled`). Turning it on starts two things: a live hook off
the same MQTT review stream push already subscribes to, and a periodic
reconciler that reads `reviewsegment` directly every `reconcile_interval_s`
seconds -- the reconciler is the belt: anything the live hook missed, saw
only partially, or (on a fresh install) everything from the last
`backfill_lookback_s` seconds gets picked up there.

## How linking works

A new atom joins the most confident matching open encounter, or starts a new
one:

- **Same identity** (a shared `sub_label`) joins regardless of camera --
  confidence 0.95.
- **Same camera**, **shared zone name**, or a configured **adjacent**
  camera join with decreasing confidence (0.9 / 0.8 / 0.6), as long as the
  gap since the encounter's last activity is within `gap_s` for the label
  family the new atom and the encounter actually **share** (person/vehicle/
  animal/default, or, for a label with no named family, the label itself --
  a waste bin and a garage door are separate families, not lumped into one
  shared "default") -- three times that allowance on an identity match.
- **Companionship** (0.7): no shared label family needed if the atom's time
  span overlaps the encounter's by at least `min_copresence_s` and the
  camera is the same as or adjacent to one of the encounter's
  `recent_cameras` most-recently-visited cameras -- this is how "person and
  dog together, then the dog alone next door" stays one encounter.
- An encounter's total span is capped at `max_duration_s`; past that (or
  quiet long enough) it's sealed and no longer a linking candidate.
- A **lone founder** -- an atom that started its own encounter because
  nothing matched yet -- can be re-homed into a better-matching encounter
  once a later message shows a real link (e.g. companionship once two
  atoms' spans actually overlap). This only ever moves an atom that's still
  alone in its own encounter; once it shares an encounter with another
  atom, it stays put.

Camera adjacency (`/v1/encounters/adjacency`, and the Adjacency section on
the [Encounters](/encounters) page) comes from Frigate's own zone names: two
cameras sharing a zone name are adjacent. `adjacency` adds edges that
naming misses; `not_adjacent` removes a same-named pair that isn't really
the same ground. Config always wins over the zone-derived graph. Both are
live [Settings](/settings) knobs -- editing either takes effect on the next
reconcile, no restart.

## Reading the pages

The list is the last 48 hours, newest first: camera path (`alley-wide →
shed`), label/identity chips, atom count, and an open/sealed badge. Expand a
row for its atoms -- each with camera, span, labels, zones, and the
`link_reason`/confidence that put it there. The detail page adds links to
each atom's underlying Frigate events.

## Correcting encounters

Each member row on the detail page has three actions, and the page itself
has a fourth:

- **Split out** -- pulls one atom into a brand new encounter of its own. Use
  this when the linker grouped something in that doesn't belong.
- **Move to** -- pins one atom into a specific encounter (by id, typed into
  the field next to the button). Works even if the target is already
  sealed.
- **Undo decisions** -- appears once an atom has any recorded decisions;
  clears them so future automatic linking is no longer biased toward or
  away from a particular encounter (it doesn't move the atom itself).
- **Merge another encounter into this one** -- a page-level form; folds
  every atom from another encounter (by id) into the one you're viewing.

A split or a pinned move is sticky: once you've made it, the linker never
automatically moves that atom again, even across reconcile cycles or a
sealed donor/target. The same actions are available as `/v1/encounters/...`
JSON routes for scripting.

## Feed API

`GET /v1/encounters` is the app's feed: newest first by start time (ties
broken by id, so pages are stable).

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `limit` | Rows per page, 1-500 (default 200). Applied after every filter. |
| `since` | Only encounters starting at or after this epoch. |
| `before` | Only encounters starting strictly before this epoch. Page by passing the last row's `start`. |
| `camera` | Only encounters that include this camera. Comma-separated values match any of them. |
| `severity` | `alert` or `detection`: exact match on the encounter's peak severity. Anything else is a 422. |
| `tag` | `notable` or `background` (see below). `notable` also returns encounters that were never stamped. Anything else is a 422. |
| `label` | Comma-separated; matches encounters whose labels or recognised identities include any of them (case-insensitive). |
| `place` | Comma-separated place keys (`street` Public, `yard` Semi-private, `doors` Entry / exit, `private` Private, `off_limits` Restricted): encounters whose most private place is any of them. An unknown key is a 422. |

All filters combine with AND.

The default 48 hour window applies only when neither `since` nor `before` is
given; `before` alone has no lower bound.

Every encounter (list and detail) carries a `title`, computed on read and
never stored: "who + route". Who is the recognised identities followed by
the subjects from the labels (people, animals, vehicles, packages), or
"Activity" when nothing is recognisable. A personal name replaces only the
"person" subject ("Chris and dog"); a delivery brand (Amazon, UPS, FedEx,
USPS, DHL) replaces the person and any car, truck, bus or motorcycle
("Amazon and package"). The route is each member's first zone display name
(the camera name when it had no zone) in time order, e.g. "Person and dog ·
Sidewalk → Front Garden → Front Door", "Chris near Front Door" or "Person ·
Gate Face camera". Over four places it keeps the first two and the last:
"A → B → … → Z".

Every encounter also carries `stops`: its members in time order with
consecutive members on the same camera merged into one visit, each
`{camera, zone, start, end}`. `camera` is the raw camera key, `zone` the first
member's zone display name (null when it had none), `start` the earliest
member start and `end` the latest member end (null while any member is still
open). A return to an earlier camera is its own stop; there is no cap.

`GET /v1/capabilities` reports `encounters: {enabled, loops, tags,
filters}`; `enabled` mirrors `encounters.enabled`, `loops` is always `false`
for now, `tags` says encounters carry the background/notable tag, and
`filters` lists the feed filters this build understands (`tag`, `label`,
`place`, `camera`).

## Background or notable

Marcellus tags every encounter as **background** (a passer-by you rarely
need to look at) or **notable**, and records the most private place it
reached (Public, Semi-private, Entry / exit, Private or Restricted) and the
loudest answer the alert settings would give it (off, log, glance, notify or
alarm). The feed carries these as `tag`, `place` and `outcome`.

The first rule that matches decides, in this order:

1. **Multi camera**: more than one camera saw it.
2. **Left public**: it reached anywhere beyond Public.
3. **Alerted**: your alert settings would do more than just log it.
4. **Recognised**: anyone or anything was recognised by name.
5. **Animal**: an animal was seen. A person together with a dog counts as a
   dog walker, so the dog is ignored.
6. **Lingered**: someone stayed in view for at least `linger_s` seconds --
   judged by the longest single sighting, not by how long the encounter
   spans (a busy sidewalk chains passers-by into one long encounter, and
   nobody in it stayed).
7. **Night**: it began after dark.
8. Otherwise it is background, a passer-by.

The tag is fixed when the visit is recorded and refreshed only when its
members change. Later changes to your alert settings or zones do not rewrite
older encounters; `fsc encounters restamp` re-applies the current rules to
past ones on request. It prints counts by tag and reason, per camera (for
single-camera encounters), how many encounters have a sighting outside every
zone, and how many tags changed (or would, with `--dry-run`); `--json` prints
one JSON object instead.

Night means the sun is below the horizon at the
property's [Location](/guide/location), a general setting you can edit live
on [Settings](/settings#location); without one it falls back to 22:00 to
06:00 server time, which is wrong if the server runs in UTC.

**Cameras as places.** A sighting outside every zone takes the place of the
camera that saw it. Assign each camera a place under **Cameras** on the
[Settings](/settings#zones) page (the picker's default is a guess from the
camera's name, falling back to Semi-private). So a front-door camera's
zoneless detections are Entry / exit, not Public. This is used only for the
encounter tag, never for push notifications.

## Retention

Sealed encounters (and their members and decisions) older than
`retention_days` (default 30) are dropped by an hourly prune folded into the
reconciler; unsealed encounters are never pruned regardless of age. Run it
by hand with `marcellus encounters prune`.

## Observations and topology

Each member also carries a best-effort direction guess -- see
[Observations](/guide/observations) for the `first_zone`/`last_zone`/
`direction`/`heading_deg`/`dir_source` fields and the `/v1/observations`
read API that surfaces atoms directly instead of grouped by encounter.

[Camera topology](/guide/topology) covers the learned per-camera-pair
transition times, the `/v1/topology` and `/v1/cameras/{camera}/neighbours`
read APIs, the multi-lane `GET /v1/timeline`, and suggested continuations.

## Configuration

Every knob lives under `encounters:` in `sidecar.yml`. "Live" knobs can be
edited from [Settings](/settings) and take effect on the next reconcile
cycle, with no restart; the others need a restart.

| Field | Default | Live | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | no | Master switch: default off, and with it off nothing links and no reconciler runs. |
| `reconcile_interval_s` | `30.0` | yes | Seconds between reconciler cycles, the belt that catches whatever the live MQTT hook missed. |
| `backfill_lookback_s` | `86400.0` | yes | How far back over `reviewsegment` the very first cycle reaches when no watermark exists yet. |
| `gap_s` | `{animal: 180, person: 90, vehicle: 45, default: 60}` | yes | Max seconds between an encounter's last activity and a new atom, per label family (identity matches get 3x). |
| `max_duration_s` | `1800.0` | yes | Hard cap on one encounter's total span; past it the encounter seals and stops accepting atoms. |
| `recent_cameras` | `2` | yes | How many recently-visited distinct cameras count as "nearby" for the adjacency and companionship checks. |
| `min_copresence_s` | `3.0` | yes | Minimum span overlap for two atoms to count as companions with no shared label family. |
| `adjacency` | `[]` | yes | Extra camera-pair edges (`[[a, b], ...]`) beyond what shared zone names already imply. |
| `not_adjacent` | `[]` | yes | Camera-pair edges to remove despite a shared zone name; config always beats the zone-derived graph. |
| `linger_s` | `60.0` | no | Seconds one sighting (a single member of the encounter) must last for the encounter to be tagged notable ("lingered") rather than a passer-by. |
| `retention_days` | `30` | no | Age at which the hourly prune drops sealed encounters; unsealed ones are never pruned. |
| `transitions_enabled` | `false` | no | Whether the learner writes per-camera-pair transition times into `camera_transitions`. |
| `transition_min_samples` | `8` | yes | Samples an edge needs before its own percentiles are trusted (`learned`) rather than defaulted. |
| `transition_max_sample_s` | `180.0` | yes | Discard a transition sample with a bigger gap than this, so one slow crossing can't skew percentiles. |
| `transition_learn_interval_s` | `3600.0` | yes | Minimum seconds between learning scans, which are a full read over `encounter_members`. |
| `transition_learn_window_days` | `14.0` | yes | How many days back the learning scan looks for transition samples. |
| `transition_default_s` | `{p10: 2, p50: 15, p90: 60}` | yes | Fallback percentiles written for an edge with too few samples to learn from. |
| `transition_overrides` | `{}` | yes | Manual per-transition percentiles keyed `"camA>camB"` or `"camA>camB:family"`, written as `source='config'`. |
| `use_learned_gaps` | `false` | yes | Whether the linker's "adjacent" reason actually reads learned stats instead of the flat `gap_s`. |
| `transition_slack` | `1.5` | yes | Multiplier on a learned p90 when `use_learned_gaps` is on, allowing slack beyond the observed 90th percentile. |
| `timeline_max_window_s` | `21600.0` | no | Hard cap (default 6h) on the window one `GET /v1/timeline` request may ask for. |
| `continuation_w_topo` | `0.30` | yes | Continuation scoring weight for whether a real or learned edge connects the two cameras. |
| `continuation_w_time` | `0.30` | yes | Continuation scoring weight for how well the elapsed gap fits learned transition stats. |
| `continuation_w_direction` | `0.20` | yes | Continuation scoring weight for the source's exit-zone direction matching the candidate camera. |
| `continuation_w_class` | `0.20` | yes | Continuation scoring weight for same label vs. merely the same label family. |
| `continuation_min_score` | `0.25` | yes | Below this score a continuation candidate is dropped instead of suggested. |
| `continuation_likely_score` | `0.5` | yes | At or above this score a suggestion is bucketed `likely` rather than `possible`. |

The continuation weights and thresholds are explained in context under
[Camera topology](/guide/topology) "Suggested continuations".

## If it goes wrong

- Nothing appears: check `enabled`, and that `/healthz` reports an
  `encounters` state other than `disabled` (see
  [Troubleshooting](/guide/troubleshooting)).
- Rows linked before a write guard landed can carry a bad `start_time` or a
  missing `end_time`. `fsc encounters repair --dry-run` reports how many;
  drop the flag to fix them (see the [CLI reference](/guide/cli)).
- Old encounters piling up: run the prune by hand with
  `fsc encounters prune`.
